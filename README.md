Welcome to my mini web development showcase! This repo contains two beginner-friendly projects I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project 1: Dice Game – _“Let the Luck Decide!”_

A interactive dice game where two players roll a dice, and the one with the higher number wins!

Project 2: Personal Resume Website 
A neatly designed resume page with:
- Contact info, Education, Projects, Skills, and more
- Interactive features using JavaScript (toggle sections, scroll to top, etc.)
